* SCADA=Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition， 数据采集与监视控制系统

* SSID=Service Set Identifier
> A service set identifier (SSID) is a sequence of characters that uniquely names a wireless local area network (WLAN). An SSID is sometimes referred to as a "network name." This name allows stations to connect to the desired network when multiple independent networks operate in the same physical area.
